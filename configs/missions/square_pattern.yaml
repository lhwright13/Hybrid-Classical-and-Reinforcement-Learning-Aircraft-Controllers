# Square Pattern Mission Configuration
# Counter-clockwise square for waypoint navigation demo

mission:
  name: "Square Pattern"
  description: "300m counter-clockwise square at 100m altitude"

  # Mission parameters
  pattern:
    type: "square"
    size: 300.0                # meters per side
    direction: "ccw"           # counter-clockwise

  # Flight parameters
  flight:
    altitude: 100.0            # meters
    speed: 15.0                # m/s (cruise speed)
    guidance: "PP"             # Pure Pursuit (or "LOS" for line-of-sight)

  # Waypoints (auto-generated from pattern, or can be explicit)
  # Format: [north, east, altitude, speed]
  # waypoints:
  #   - [0, 0, 100, 15]        # Start/End
  #   - [300, 0, 100, 15]      # North
  #   - [300, 300, 100, 15]    # Northeast
  #   - [0, 300, 100, 15]      # East
  #   - [0, 0, 100, 15]        # Back to start

  # Initial state
  initial:
    position: [0, 0, -100]     # NED (north, east, down)
    velocity: [15, 0, 0]       # Body frame (forward, right, down)
    attitude: [0, 0, 0]        # Euler angles (roll, pitch, yaw) in radians

# Simulation parameters
simulation:
  max_duration: 180.0          # seconds
  dt: 0.01                     # timestep (100 Hz)
